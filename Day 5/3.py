#iteration is the point which changes.. because if we don't change it, it's gonna run forever. so iteration variable is very important.
#if we don't iterate, we won't be able to come out of the loop.
#break is one of the statement we can use to come out of loops
while True:
    x = "rain"
    if x == "rain":
        break
    print("no rain")
#quit() --> if I print this quit function here, all the line under this won't print hehe.
#continue says quit the current iteration and go to the next iteration
#so continue skips on top of the loop ..means contiue goes back to the while and then runs the next iteration.
#break gets out of the loop and continue skips on top of the loop
