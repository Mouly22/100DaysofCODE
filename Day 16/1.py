#int and float are considered to be simple or primitive or atomic data types 
#because their values are not composed of any smaller parts. They cannot be broken down.
#On the other hand, strings and lists are different from the others because they are made up of smaller pieces. 
#In the case of strings,they are made up of smaller strings each containing one character.
