Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, 

in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period. this sentence contains a syntax error. So does this one

Syntax rules in Python include requirements such as these:
Statements must generally be written one per line; 
the print statement must surround the value to be shown in parenthesis; 
expressions must be correctly formed.
The following lines contain syntax errors:

```
print(Hello, world!)
print "Hello, world!"
print(5 + )
```
here we have SyntaxError.

Another error is RunTimeError. A program with a runtime error is one that passed the interpreterâ€™s syntax checks, and started to execute.
