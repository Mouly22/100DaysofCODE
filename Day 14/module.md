A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in other Python programs.Modules allows you to only use the functionality you need when you need it, and it keeps your code cleaner.
Functions imported as part of a module live in their own namespace. A namespace is simply a space within which all names are distinct from each other. The same name can be reused in different namespaces but two objects can’t have the same name within a single namespace. One example of a namespace is the set of street names within a single city. Many cities have a street called “Main Street”, but it’s very confusing if two streets in the same city have that name! Another example is the folder organization of file systems. You can have a file called todo in your work folder as well as your personal folder, but you know which is which because of the folder it’s in; each folder has its own namespace for files. Note that human names are not part of a namespace that enforces uniqueness; that’s why governments have invented unique identifiers to assign to people, like passport numbers.
In order to use Python modules, you have to import them into a Python program
When you see imported modules in a Python program, there are a few variations that have slightly different consequences.
1)The most common is import morecode. That imports everything in morecode.py. To invoke a function f1 that is defined in morecode.py, you would write morecode.f1(). Note that you have to explicitly mention morecode again, to specify that you want the f1 function from the morecode namespace. If you just write f1(), python will look for an f1 that was defined in the current file, rather than in morecode.py.
2)You can also give the imported module an alias (a different name, just for when you use it in your program). For example, after executing import morecode as mc, you would invoke f1 as mc.f1(). You have now given the morecode module the alias mc. Programmers often do this to make code easier to type.
3)A third possibility for importing occurs when you only want to import SOME of the functionality from a module, and you want to make those objects be part of the current module’s namespace. For example, you could write from morecode import f1. Then you could invoke f1 without referencing morecode again: f1().
