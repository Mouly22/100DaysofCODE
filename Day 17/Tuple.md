<h2> Tuple </h2>

A tuple, like a list, is a sequence of items of any type. The printed representation of a tuple is a comma-separated sequence of values, enclosed in parentheses. In other words, the representation is just like lists, except with parentheses () instead of square brackets [].
<h5>The key difference between lists and tuples is that a tuple is immutable, meaning that its contents canâ€™t be changed after the tuple is created.</h5>
