<h2> List </h2>
A list is a sequential collection of Python data values, where each value is identified by an index. The values that make up a list are called its elements. Lists are similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the elements of a list can have any type and for any one list, the items can be of different types.

There are several ways to create a new list. The simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets[]
```
w = []                                           #empty list
x = [200,400,600,1000]                           #list with integer values
y = ["rock", "paper", "sizer"]                   #string values
z = ["magic", 9.0, 8, [1,3,5]]                   #multiple type values
```
A list can contain multiple datatypes even including a list in a single list.
